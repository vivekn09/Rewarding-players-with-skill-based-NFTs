## Project Title
Skill-Based NFT Reward System

## Project Description
The Skill-Based NFT Reward System is a blockchain-based solution that rewards players with NFTs based on their skill levels and achievements. Each player can accumulate skill points in various categories, and upon reaching predefined thresholds, they are awarded NFTs that represent their expertise. These NFTs are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and security.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to gamify the learning and skill-development process by leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs. The platform aims to motivate users to improve their skills, celebrate their achievements, and create a tangible record of their progress in the form of digital collectibles.

## Key Features
1. **Skill Tracking**: 
   - Tracks individual skill levels for players across multiple skill categories.
   - Allows players to accumulate points and progress over time.

2. **Tier-Based NFT Rewards**:
   - NFTs are awarded when players achieve specific milestones:
     - Bronze (100 points)
     - Silver (250 points)
     - Gold (500 points)
     - Diamond (1000 points)

3. **Unique NFT Metadata**:
   - Each NFT is associated with a unique token URI containing details about the skill, tier, and token ID.

4. **Transparency and Ownership**:
   - Players own their NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring true digital ownership.
   - Transparent skill progression and reward system.

5. **Event Logging**:
   - Emits events for skill increases and NFT rewards to ensure traceability.

6. **Extensible Design**:
   - The contract can be extended to include additional features such as skill-specific badges, trading of NFTs, or integrations with other platforms.

## Usage
- **Skill Increase**: Skill levels are increased by the contract owner (admin), representing achievements or milestones reached by the player.
- **Reward NFTs**: Automatically mints and rewards NFTs when players achieve new skill thresholds.
- **View Details**:
  - Players can check their skill levels for various categories.
  - Token holders can view the NFT metadata to see skill tier and other information.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for decentralized skill validation through external oracles.
- Integration with gaming platforms or online learning systems.
- Marketplace functionality for trading or showcasing NFTs.
